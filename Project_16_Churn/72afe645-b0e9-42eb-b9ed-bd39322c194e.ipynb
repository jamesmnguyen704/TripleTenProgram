    "2. **Model Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the types of models that can be used, such as interpretability requirements or computational limits?\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Besides the AUC-ROC score, are there any other evaluation metrics that should be considered, such as precision, recall, or F1-score, especially given the class imbalance?\n",
    "4. **High-Risk Customers**: Do we need to identify high-risk customers, and how frequently will the data be updated?\n",

    "     - Analyze the balance of the dataset and investigate class imbalances.\n",
    "     - Identify potential features that correlate strongly with churn, such as tenure, monthly charges, and additional services.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Create new features and refine existing ones to improve the model’s predictive power.\n",

    "   - **Objective**: Develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "   - **Steps**:\n",
    "     - Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "     - Use boosting algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for classification.\n",

    "Final Scores and Conclusion\n",
    "Throughout this project, we delved into the intricacies of customer churn with the aim of identifying potential patterns that distinguish churned customers from active members. Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed many interesting patterns in the data, setting the stage for our predictive models. One of the most intriguing patterns we found was that a significant portion of churn occurred among the newest members (less than 5 months of active membership).\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed several models, primarily focusing on gradient boosting due to the nonlinearity in the data. This approach led to models that effectively predict churn versus non-churn rates, achieving performance above the 75 ROC-AUC minimum threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best score we achieved was an AUC-ROC of 84 with the CatBoost classifier. The hyperparameters for this model were: learning_rate = 0.01, max_depth = 3, and n_estimators = 1000.\n",

    "Performed Steps: We conducted comprehensive EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. We focused on gradient boosting models due to the data's nonlinearity.\n",
    "Skipped Steps: Certain advanced hyperparameter tuning methods were skipped due to computational resource limitations and time constraints.\n",
    "What difficulties did you encounter and how did you manage to solve them?\n",

    "Difficulties: One major challenge was handling the class imbalance in the dataset. We addressed this by using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the training data.\n",

    "I encountered some difficulties in the data preparation segment of the project. I made a couple of errors in properly scaling and preparing the data for use in cross-validation, and in encoding without data leakage. These were relatively simple problems that didn't require a lot of time to solve but had the potential to drastically alter the results of the project if they hadn't been corrected.\n",

    "\n",
    "EDA: Understanding all the features was crucial since there were many that covered different aspects of each customer. Spending time to decipher each feature and create visual diagrams to show relationships between them and churn was essential for understanding the data.\n",
    "Data Preparation: Being thorough and meticulous in handling the data was important. Ensuring the data was scaled without leakage between training and test sets, using proper One-Hot Encoding (OHE) techniques, and employing appropriate sampling techniques were key steps.\n",
    "Model Training: Using GridSearchCV was pivotal in finding the best hyperparameters, making the process simpler and more efficient.\n",
    "What is your final model and what quality score does it have?\n",
    "My final model is the CatBoost classifier with a learning rate (lr) of 0.01, max depth of 3, and 1000 estimators. I achieved an ROC-AUC score of 84.4."
