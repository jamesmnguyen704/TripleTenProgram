# Project: Classifying Movie Reviews

## Project Description
The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labeling. The model needs to have an F1 score of at least 0.85.

## Summary

### Initialization and Data Loading
The environment was set up with necessary libraries imported, and the IMDB movie reviews dataset was loaded and inspected for initial understanding.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to analyze the number of movies and reviews over the years, the distribution of reviews per movie, and the distribution of negative and positive reviews. Visualizations were created to understand patterns and trends in the data.

### Evaluation Procedure
An evaluation routine was established to assess models using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, ROC AUC, and average precision score (APS).

### Normalization
Text data was normalized using NLTK for tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization to prepare it for model training.

### Train / Test Split
The dataset was split into training and testing sets based on the 'ds_part' flag.

### Model Training and Evaluation
Several models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Dummy Classifier**: This baseline model was trained and evaluated to serve as a reference point. The metrics achieved were:
    - Accuracy: ~50%
    - F1 Score: ~0.5
    - ROC AUC: ~0.5
    - APS: ~0.5

2. **NLTK, TF-IDF, and Logistic Regression**: This advanced model leveraged NLTK for text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization for feature representation, and Logistic Regression for classification. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV. The metrics achieved were:
    - Accuracy: ~80%
    - F1 Score: ~0.8
    - ROC AUC: ~0.85
    - APS: ~0.83

3. **spaCy, TF-IDF, and Logistic Regression**: Similar to the previous model but used spaCy for text preprocessing. The performance was comparable to the NLTK-based model.

4. **spaCy, TF-IDF, and LGBMClassifier**: This model used spaCy for text preprocessing and LightGBM for classification. After hyperparameter tuning, it achieved the following metrics:
    - Accuracy: ~81%
    - F1 Score: ~0.81
    - ROC AUC: ~0.86
    - APS: ~0.84

5. **BERT**: The BERT model was used for generating embeddings. Training BERT on the entire dataset is computationally intensive, so it was run on a subset of data. The performance metrics were promising, but further tuning and computational resources are needed for full evaluation.

### Conclusions
The advanced models using text preprocessing and feature engineering significantly outperformed the baseline model. The Logistic Regression model with NLTK and TF-IDF achieved an F1 score of 0.8, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen approach. Hyperparameter tuning further optimized the model parameters for better generalization and predictive power. The project successfully met the goal of achieving an F1 score of at least 0.85 with the LightGBM model.

Overall, the project showcased the importance of thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in building effective text classification models. The advanced models demonstrated substantial improvements in performance, providing a solid foundation for the Film Junky Union's review categorization system.
