    "\n",
    "1. With DecisionTreeClassifier, we varied the depth of the tree from 1 to 10. We found that the best model has a depth of 3 and an accuracy of 78%. However, the predictions in the training set were overfitted.\n",
    "2. With RandomForestClassifier, we obtained the best model with a 79% accuracy using 13 trees with a depth of 2. The predictions in the training set did not show overfitting, which is a good indication.\n",
    "3. With LogisticRegression, our model achieved a 76% accuracy, which is lower than the previous models. We also observed that the prediction with the training set does not precede the prediction with the validation set, meaning there is no overfitting from the training data.\n",
    "Therefore, we can determine that the predictive model uses the RandomForestClassifier learning algorithm. The forest is composed of 13 trees with a depth of 2. The quality of the model was measured by an accuracy of 77%, exceeding the accuracy threshold initially set in the objective of this analysis and also surpassing the sanity check.\n",
